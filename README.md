This repository contains my solutions and projects from the Scientific Computing with Python course by freeCodeCamp. 
The course is a part of freeCodeCamp's curriculum designed to provide a solid foundation in Python programming, focusing on practical applications for scientific computing. 
Throughout the course, I have completed several projects that demonstrate key skills in Python, problem-solving, and data manipulation.
